[![Author: David](https://img.shields.io/badge/👋-Kaixo!-gggddd.svg)], I'm a software engineer based in Bilbao, Spain, currently working at [✨Tecnalia✨](https://www.tecnalia.com/), the leading research center in the Basque Country. My focus is on developing innovative applications using advanced technologies, such as 3D vision and applied artificial intelligence, to create tech-driven solutions. At the beginning of my tech career, I gained significant experience at [Indexa Capital](https://indexacapital.com/es/esp/), where I worked for six years and grew both professionally and personally. There, I led a team of three developers, supporting their growth and contributing to Indexa’s success by applying agile methodologies and robust design principles like DDD and SOLID. This approach enabled us to launch several successful products, giving me a strong foundation in software development. Beyond coding, I’m passionate about innovation, photography, and writing. I love working on projects that matter to me—whether it’s exploring AI’s potential or crafting solutions for causes close to my heart.

Here are some of my I.T. projects:

- 🎯 [Django DDD template](https://github.com/davidcerezal/docker-django-ddd)
- 💡 [Symfony light template](https://github.com/davidcerezal/symfony_api_project)
- 🤖 [Instagram's bot](https://github.com/davidcerezal/instabot)
- ⚡ [Energy price predictor](https://github.com/davidcerezal/energy-price-predictor)
- 🗺️ [Spain D3 map](https://github.com/davidcerezal/spain-d3-map)

Apart from that, I have other project in which I sometimes write or update:

- ✍️ [@pic.dave](https://www.instagram.com/pic.dave/) where I write for myself.
- 📖 [Personal Blog](https://davidcerezal.github.io/) where sometimes I upload some new projects I try.
- 👨🏻‍💻 [JXtattoo](https://jxtattoo.github.io/) where I try with React and also help a friend.
- 👨🏻‍💻 [Juriesquemas](https://juriesquemas.es/) I contribute to the management of content and the future direction of the company.
