### Kaixo! 👋

**"Obsessed with making my own tiny contribution to this world, but doing it with a reason."**

I’m David, a software engineer living in Madrid, España. Since some years, I have set myself goals such as creating new projects, go in-depth in the spirit of the entrepreneur and be in constant development. For now I have a lot to learn, and I hope that it will always continue; while I am trying to get these goals I work as BackEnd Developer in [✨Indexa Capital✨](https://indexacapital.com/es/esp/), in which I learn from the bests. In the little free time I have left, I like to explore the exciting world of AI (master in machine learning) that I hope will help me to achieve the goal of creating new projects that make a significant change, but they must have a reason and not just an economic purpose.

Here are some of my I.T. projects:

- 🎯 [Django DDD template](https://github.com/davidcerezal/docker-django-ddd)
- 💡 [Symfony light template](https://github.com/davidcerezal/symfony_api_project)
- 🤖 [Instagram's bot](https://github.com/davidcerezal/instabot)
- 📷 [AWS photo OCR](https://github.com/davidcerezal/flask_aws_textextract)
- ⚡ [Energy price predictor](https://github.com/davidcerezal/energy-price-predictor)
- 📖 my [personal blog](https://github.com/davidcerezal/davidcerezal.github.io) check it out on [DavidCerezal](https://davidcerezal.github.io/)

Apart from that, I have other project in which I sometimes write:

- ✍️ [Cerecea](https://github.com/cerecea/cerecea.github.io) in where I write for [pic.dave](https://www.instagram.com/pic.dave/)
