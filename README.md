[![Author: David](https://img.shields.io/badge/👋-Kaixo!-gggddd.svg)], a software engineer living in Madrid, España. Since some years, I have set myself goals such as creating new projects, go in-depth in the spirit of the entrepreneur and be in constant development. For now I have a lot to learn, and I hope that it will always continue; while I am trying to get these goals I work as BackEnd Developer and manage a small team in [✨Indexa Capital✨](https://indexacapital.com/es/esp/), in which I learn from the bests (both in development and in team management). In the spare time I have left, I keep projects of photography and writing ([@pic.dave](https://www.instagram.com/pic.dave/)), and some friends projects in which I try with new technologies (React). I also move in the exciting world of AI (master in machine learning) that I hope will help me achieve the goal of creating new projects that make a significant change, that have a reason and not just an economic purpose.

Here are some of my I.T. projects:

- 🎯 [Django DDD template](https://github.com/davidcerezal/docker-django-ddd)
- 💡 [Symfony light template](https://github.com/davidcerezal/symfony_api_project)
- 🤖 [Instagram's bot](https://github.com/davidcerezal/instabot)
- 📷 [AWS photo OCR](https://github.com/davidcerezal/flask_aws_textextract)
- ⚡ [Energy price predictor](https://github.com/davidcerezal/energy-price-predictor)
- 🗺️ [Spain D3 map](https://github.com/davidcerezal/spain-d3-map)

Apart from that, I have other project in which I sometimes write:

- ✍️ [Cerecea](https://cerecea.github.io/) where I write as [@pic.dave](https://www.instagram.com/pic.dave/)
- 📖 [Personal Blog](https://davidcerezal.github.io/) where I write for myself.
- 👨🏻‍💻 [JXtattoo](https://jxtattoo.github.io/) where I try with React and also help a friend.
